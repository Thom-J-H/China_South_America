# China_South_America

This project explores China's investment in South America, based on the [China Global Investment Tracker](https://www.aei.org/china-global-investment-tracker/) data set, created and maintained by Derek Scissors at the <em>American Enterprise Institute</em>, and freely available for download. We thank Derek Scissors and the <em>AEI</em> for publicly sharing this vital data set.

China, according to the [Belt and Road Research Platform](https://www.beltroadresearch.com/), is either the number one or number two trade partner for the majority of South American nations. In fact, in terms of economic hegemony, <em>Bloomberg News</em> ([18 February 2022](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-17/china-is-south-america-s-top-trading-partner-why-can-t-the-us-keep-up)) has already conceded South America to China: “How China Beat Out the U.S. to Dominate South America.” Although history is obviously still being written, the data does support this claim.
